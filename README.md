  Freddy Krueger, from Nightmare on elm street joins the game! To download it, you can use the Thunderstore at {NO PAGE YET}. 
  Developers will be able to find information here and add their part to the project. The version here is the main version of Freddy, 
  but any developers have the right to work on him but they'll need to talk to me so I can integrate their code into the project.
  You can find me in the official Lethal Company server. My discord name is Xilef992

  You can use the code in this github but in no case can money be made with the use of this code except with implicite permission from me.
