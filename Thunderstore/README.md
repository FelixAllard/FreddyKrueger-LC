# Freddy Krueger - [New Enemy]

This mod adds Freddy Krueger from "Nightmare on Elm Street" as a fully animated and customised enemy. Freddy brings a special sleep mechanic and targets only players that are asleep while leaving the awake alone. This is the first every build of this mod and there will be a lot of updates upon this mod. If you want to talk to me, go on the official Lethal Company Modding server and give me feedback on any issues so I may fix them. I also gave a link to my Github if you want to inspire yourself from my code, which I don't suggest for I am quite the messy coder.
