# Freddy Krueger - [New Enemy]

This mod adds Freddy Krueger from "Nightmare on Elm Street" as a fully animated and customised enemy. Freddy brings a special sleep mechanic and targets only players that are asleep while leaving the awake alone. This is the first every build of this mod and there will be a lot of updates upon this mod. If you want to talk to me, go on the official Lethal Company Modding server and give me feedback on any issues so I may fix them. I also gave a link to my Github if you want to inspire yourself from my code, which I don't suggest for I am quite the messy coder.

FREDDY BEHAVIOUR:
It waits for people to enter sleep and then chooses which player asleep it want to targets. It will also be invisible, unearable and uninteractable to awake player. When close to being asleep, player will hear a lulaby counting to 10 before being officialy asleep.

Freddy is NOT an indoor enemy, he can move between indoor and outdoor easily

Asleep :
Freddy will decide which player is in most trouble and start chasing the player teleporting around him at a random.

Walking : Freddy will walk towards you at slow pace but will make sound when walking
Running : Freddy will run towards you at a fast pace and will make heavy sounds
Sneaking : Freddy will try yo catch the player off guards by nt making any sounds and f seen will teleport away
Running with claw : Freddy will run at a fast pace non stop towards the target player until he is dead. Only happens if the player sleep goes way to high

Kill behaviour : Freddy does like the little girl and sends your head flying

KNOWN ISSUE :
-Model visible when exiting ship
-Scan node doesn't bring anything to the terminal
-When leaving the session and entering a new one without restarting game, freddy doesn't work
