# Freddy Krueger - New Enemy

This mod adds Freddy Krueger from "Nightmare on Elm Street" as a fully animated and customized enemy. Freddy brings a special sleep mechanic and targets only players that are asleep, leaving the awake ones alone. This is the first build of the mod, with more updates to come. Feel free to provide feedback and report any issues on the official Lethal Company Modding server.

## Freddy's Behavior

Freddy waits for players to fall asleep and then chooses which sleeping player to target. He is invisible, unhearable, and uninteractable to awake players. When a player is close to falling asleep, they will hear a lullaby counting to 10 before officially falling asleep.

Freddy is not limited to indoor environments; he can move seamlessly between indoor and outdoor areas.
Bring asleep is a special state and more on it will be added onto it in the future

- **Asleep**: Freddy will determine which player is in the most trouble and start chasing them, teleporting around at random.
- **Walking**: Freddy will walk towards players at a slow pace, making noise as he moves.
- **Running**: Freddy will run towards players at a fast pace, emitting heavy sounds.
- **Sneaking**: Freddy will attempt to catch players off guard by making no sounds. If seen, he will teleport away.
- **Running with Claw**: Freddy will relentlessly chase a target player at a fast pace until they are dead. This only occurs if the player's sleep level becomes too high.

When Freddy kills a player, their head will be sent flying.
